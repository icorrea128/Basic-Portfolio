                My name is Ismael Correa. I am a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. I majored in Economics, and Political Science, with a minor in business. In my spare time I love to listen to music and learn how to program. My roots come from Mexico and Colombia which means I am a first generation immigrant in the United States. I am excited about the future after this coding bootcamp as I plan to get into entrepreneurial activities with friends from college.
